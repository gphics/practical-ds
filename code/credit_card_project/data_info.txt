About Dataset
The Credit Card Transactions Dataset provides detailed records of credit card transactions, including information about transaction times, amounts, and associated personal and merchant details. This dataset has over 1.85M rows.

How This Dataset Can Be Used:

Fraud Detection : Use machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions by examining patterns in transaction amounts, locations, and user profiles. Enhancing fraud detection systems becomes feasible by analyzing behavioral patterns.

Customer Segmentation : Segment customers based on spending patterns, location, and demographics. Tailor marketing strategies and personalized offers to these different customer segments for better engagement.

Transaction Classification : Classify transactions into categories such as grocery or entertainment to understand spending behaviors. This helps in improving recommendation systems by identifying transaction categories and preferences.

Geospatial Analysis : Analyze transaction data geographically to map spending patterns and detect regional trends or anomalies based on latitude and longitude.

Predictive Modeling : Build models to forecast future spending behavior using historical transaction data. Predict potential fraudulent activities and financial trends.

Behavioral Analysis : Examine how factors like transaction amount, merchant type, and time influence spending behavior. Study the relationships between user demographics and transaction patterns.

Anomaly Detection : Identify unusual transaction patterns that deviate from normal behavior to detect potential fraud early. Employ anomaly detection techniques to spot outliers and suspicious activities.

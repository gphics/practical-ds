### Objectives
1. Loan Default Prediction: Build a classification model to predict loan repayment.
2. Credit Risk Analysis: Analyze the relationship between income, credit score, and loan defaults.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract new insights from employment history, home ownership, and loan amounts.
4. Data exploration

#### Data Exploration

##### Demographics:
    * Income Distribution: What is the average and median income of loan applicants, and how does it differ between those who repay and those who default?

    * Employment Stability: Does the length of employment or "Years at Current Job" correlate with a lower likelihood of default?

    * Education & Professional Level: How do loan default/repay rates vary across different education levels (e.g., Graduate vs. Non-Graduate)?

    * Regional Insights: Which home ownership shows the highest concentration of loan applications or default rates?

##### Loan details and features:
    * Loan Purpose: What are the most common reasons for seeking a loan (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement, small business), and which category has the highest risk?

    * Interest Rates: Is there a clear relationship between higher interest rates and an increase in defaults?
